Link (works until December 19th 2024) : https://lilzfleur.pythonanywhere.com/

Requirements: 
- Pyhton
- Pip
- Git
- Zsh/linux terminal 

### Step by step 
__1. Clone project__

* Open a terminal, ideally a mac/linux terminal, and write the following command 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lilya-CB/do-you-love-me.git
```

__2. Set up the environment__
Since this is a python project, you have to create a virtual environment. In order to do that. You have to use the following commands: 

```bash
cd do-you-love-me
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

These commands will show a `(venv)` before the command line. That means that you're set up to download the project dependencies! 

__3. Download dependencies__

This project is really small, it only requires to add flask (which is a framework).
